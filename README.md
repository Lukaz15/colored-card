### Colored Card

This is just a very quick project I made to test my setup with Vite, React, Typescript and Styled-components.

I'll add features to this as I experiment with the possibilities.


### Features

- A card is on the center of the screen. The user can change its color by typing it as a hexcode on the input above.
- There is regular expressions used in order to ensure the user only submits valid hexcode.
